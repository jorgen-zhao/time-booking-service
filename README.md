# timeBookingService code challenge

## what I need to do ?

1. Calculate working time. â‡’ as a hr, we want to retrive how many hours an employee worked.
2. Check and inform for missing booking. â‡’ tool automatically informs when an employee forget to book his time on the same day.



## ThinkingðŸ¤”

### how to calculate working time?

Here is my thinking:

**key**: We can mark two time as `start` and `end` time. Check-in time will in the middle. So when we calculate working hours, just querying time using between...and...

**steps:**

1. First in order to calculate the working time, so the employee should have two times. I just use the last one minus the first one. 

2. How to get the correct time? So I decide to create a constant like 

   ```Java
   private ZonedDateTime MORNING_CHECK_TIME = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate.now().atTime(8, 30), ZoneOffset.UTC);
   private ZonedDateTime EVENING_CHECK_TIME = ZonedDateTime.of(LocalDate.now().atTime(20, 30), ZoneOffset.UTC);
   ```

3. Using the `JPA` get employee's time between  `MORNING_CHECK_TIME` and `EVENING_CHECK_TIME` and make sure it must to 2 time.
4. Using this way, we can get a employee working time.(But the result contains the Lunch Break, we can do it laterðŸ˜„)



### Check and inform for missing booking.

Here is my thinking:

**key:** Define a effective check-in time. As if employee time at the duration. It's not missing. 

**steps:**

1. Using Java Sheduler framework to run at a definite time every day, using `cron expression` like `0 0 10,21 * * ? *`.
2. When it start, using `JPA` query every employee's time in that day, and check the time whether at the duration.
3. If a employee forget check-in in the morning, the tool will automatically informs at 10:00, evening is same too.
4. If the constant time is too late or just inform once is too little, we can change cron expression to meet our demands.
